                <p>Never miss out on all the doggy action by finding all of NYC's dog parks laid out on our iOS and desktop maps.
                Your favorite park is only a pinch and zoom away.
                Looking for photos of cute dogs?  There is an app for that!  Use Hey Walkies to upload and browse all the best in show of your local dog park.
                </p>
                <p>
                Make no bones about it, New Yorkers love their dogs.
                You'd be hard pressed to walk a block without bumping into a Frenchie, Jack Russell or Labrador hotfooting it to the local doggy park.
                And it's not just the pups that are loving their doggy park experience.
                Dog owners throughout NY are connecting with other owners and creating a community, meeting people, friends, lovers -
                all through the shared experience of letting their dogs run wild.</p>
                </p>
                <p>
                While dog owners may know the whereabouts of dog parks in their own neighborhoods, as of yet there is not a resource for locating dog parks around the city.
                Hey Walkies helps owners find parks for their dogs to play in wherever they may be in NYC.
                Hey Walkies also taps into Facebook, bringing the world's largest social network to the people and pups that use our site.
                </p>
                <p>Apple loves Hey Walkies so much that they decided to feature it in their "Dog Lovers" TV commercial.</p>

                Neverland Lost presents Henry Leutwyler's record of the contents of the late
                Michael Jackson's famous Peter Pan paradise at the Neverland Ranch,
                in Santa Barbara, California. Leutwyler gained privileged access to Jackson's
                possessions when they were due to be auctioned off (but were eventually withdrawn),
                shortly before Jackson's death on June 25, 2009.
                Creating incredible taxonomies of Jackson's huge array of possessions,
                as they were briefly exhibited at the Ranch, Leutwyler subjects these
                items to a degree of scrutiny that makes the viewer feel she or he
                could slip on one of those iconic spangly gloves. It is of course
                Jackson's performance accessories-the accessories by which he was
                instantly identifiable to all, such as the gloves,
                the hats and shoes-that leap out of this fascinating volume.
                Laying bare the components and props of the Michael Jackson myth,
                these photographs create a strange and fantastical visual story
                of "The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up," at the moment he was forced to leave Neverland.

                Splitting her time between New York and Amsterdam, London-trained photographer Dana Lixenberg is known for her stripped-down,
                candid style of portraiture––but it’s her recent still lifes that have been gaining momentum.
                “I treat still lifes as portraits—it’s a different process, clearly, but my approach remains the same,” she says.
                Lixenberg’s lauded no-gimmick, in-the-moment method has led to commissions by the likes of the New York Times Magazine,
                The New Yorker and Newsweek.

                “My grandfather and father were both printers. I decided not to follow their path,
                instead to travel and photograph, soaking up color and culture from around the world.

                Today, Leutwyler’s celebrity portraits can be found in the pages of Vogue,

                He has photographed the likes of Michelle Obama, Julia Roberts, Tom Wolfe, Iggy Pop,
